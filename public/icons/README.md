# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Progressive Web App:

- `icon-192x192.png` (192×192 pixels)
- `icon-384x384.png` (384×384 pixels)
- `icon-512x512.png` (512×512 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools like:

1. [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
2. [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator)
3. [App Icon Generator](https://appicon.co/)

Make sure the icons are:
- Square in shape
- Have a transparent background or a background that matches your app's theme
- Are clear and recognizable even at smaller sizes

These icons will be used by browsers and operating systems when users install your PWA on their devices.
